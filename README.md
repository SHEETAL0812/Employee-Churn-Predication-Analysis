# Employee-Churn-Predication-Analysis by Using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression Models
A Data Mining Project on Human Resources Analytics - Employee Churn Predication Analysis 

# Client: Progressive Limited

# Business Problem: 
Rapid employee turnover leading to financial instability and potential bankruptcy.

# Objectives:
●Identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover.

●Develop a predictive model to assess employee attrition risk.

●Design and enhance targeted employee retention strategies.

●Facilitate improved decision-making for management through model implementation.

# Data Mining Pipeline 

The project followed a standard data mining pipeline:

1.**Data Acquisition:** Obtained a simulated "Human Resources Analytics" dataset from Kaggle.

2.**Data Cleaning:** Minimal cleaning required as the dataset was relatively clean.

3.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical overviews, correlation analysis, and distribution plots.

4.**Predictive Modeling:** Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.

5.**Interpretation of Results:** Drawing conclusions, identifying key insights, and formulating recommendations for a retention plan.
